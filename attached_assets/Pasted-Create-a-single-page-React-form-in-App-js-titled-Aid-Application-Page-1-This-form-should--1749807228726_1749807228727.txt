Create a single-page React form in `App.js` titled **"Aid Application - Page 1"**. This form should include the following fields exactly as listed below — no additional fields, and do not omit any. Group them under two sections: **Applicant Basic Details** and **Financial Background**.

All form state should be managed using React `useState`. Use basic HTML input elements (text, radio, number, textarea, etc.) and ensure each field is labeled clearly.

Please enhance the existing React form in App.js with clean and user-friendly styling.

Guidelines for styling:

1. Wrap the entire form in a centered container with padding, white background, rounded corners, and a subtle box shadow.
2. Add a main title at the top: "Aid Application - Page 1".
3. Use section headings: "Applicant Basic Details" and "Financial Background".
4. Each input field should be:
   - Stacked vertically
   - With a bold label on top
   - Inputs should be full width, with padding and border-radius
   - Proper spacing between fields
5. Group radio options and dropdowns neatly in rows or columns with clear spacing.
6. Style the "Next" button:
   - Full width
   - Background: dark blue (#0077cc)
   - Text color: white
   - Rounded corners and padding
   - Hover effect: darker shade
7. Make the form responsive on smaller screens.
8. Use only plain CSS or update `App.css`. Avoid any external libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
