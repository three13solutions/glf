Create a single-page React form in `App.js` titled **"Aid Application - Page 1"**. This form should include the following fields exactly as listed below — no additional fields, and do not omit any. Group them under two sections: **Applicant Basic Details** and **Financial Background**.

All form state should be managed using React `useState`. Use basic HTML input elements (text, radio, number, textarea, etc.) and ensure each field is labeled clearly.
